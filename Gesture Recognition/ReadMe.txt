The Project requires MATLAB 2016 to run.

The Code Folder contains codes for different modules

1.Hand Gesture Recognition through Skin Detection
2.Hand_Gesture Recognition through Fixed Box
3.Hand Gesture Recognition through Red Object
4.Character Recognition


To run the first two files no special objects are needed to run them.
However ,for the last two you need a red object (say a red tape).

1.Hand Gesture Recognition through Skin Detection
Make the Dataset folder as current working directory in MATLAB.
The camera should be at an angle so that the face doesn't shows in the camera.
Show your gesture in the camera.
The project shows the matching gesture on screen along with voice Output.


2.Hand_Gesture Recognition through Fixed Box
Make the Dataset folder as the current working directory in MATLAB.
From the codes folder run the Hand Gesture Recognition through Fixed Box.m
At the start wait for 2 seconds, the camera clicks th background image .
Then place your hand making the required gesture in the green box on screen.
Wait for the timer to click the picture.
The result shows up on screen.
The required gesture is converted to text and is spoken out.


3. Hand Gesture Recognition through Red Object
From the codes folder run the Hand Gesture Recognition through Red Object
You need to stick a red tape to the base of your palm.
Project your hand in front of the camera, the camera detects your hand and automatically makes a box around your hand.
Keep your hand in the same position until the timer expires.
The results then pops on the screen.

4. Character Recognition:
From the codes folder open and run the Character Recognition.m file.
You need a red Object(say a red tape) to be sticked to your finger.
Point your finger(on which the tape is sticked) towards the camera.
The camera detects the finger and now it maps the gesture you draw on the screen.
